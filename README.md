# Parkinsons Help App

This is an Android application that helps patients with certain symptoms of parkinsons. Right now the application is in the proof of concept stage.

One symptom some people with parkinsons suffer from is known as "freezing". Like the name suggests, a freezing episode is when someone with parkinsons struggles to take the first step from a standing position. One largely successful way to end an episode is to put an object in front of the person like a leg or a laser pointer. This gives the person a target to step on, and once they take the first step the episode is over and they can walk until stopping. This is discussed in this [video](https://youtu.be/VwUoAMAis1g?t=156).

This app aims to solve that issue by overlaying an image of a leg over a feed of the camera, simulating someone putting their leg in front of the patient. This proof of concept has been tested on one patient and was able to successfully end a freezing episode.
